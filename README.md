# OpenSSL Web Frontend

`openssl-web` is a web-based interface for interacting with OpenSSL directly through your browser. It allows you to run OpenSSL commands like generating certificates, private keys, CSRs, and more, all without needing to install anything on your local machine.

This project leverages the power of OpenSSL through a web interface, making it easy for anyone to execute cryptographic operations directly from a browser.

## Features

- **Generate SSL Certificates**: Quickly generate self-signed or CA-signed certificates.
- **Create Private Keys**: Generate RSA, DSA, or EC private keys.
- **Generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)**: Create CSRs for SSL certificates.
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Data**: Encrypt or decrypt data using OpenSSL's powerful algorithms.
- **Create Hashes**: Generate hash values (e.g., SHA-256, MD5) from input data.
- **Public/Private Key Operations**: Perform operations on keys, such as conversion and extraction.

## Usage

1. **Visit the Web Interface**: Open your browser and navigate to the hosted URL where `openssl-web` is running (e.g., `https://example.com/`).

2. **Select an Operation**: Choose the operation you'd like to perform, such as:
   - Generate SSL certificates or keys
   - Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
   - Encrypt/Decrypt data
   - Generate hashes

3. **Fill Out the Required Information**: Depending on the operation, provide necessary details (e.g., common name for certificates, key size, data to hash, etc.).

4. **Execute the Command**: Once the form is filled, click the **Generate** or **Execute** button to run the OpenSSL command.

5. **Download the Output**: After the operation is complete, download the generated file (certificate, key, etc.) directly from the browser.

## Security Considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure the web interface is hosted securely with HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping on sensitive information.
- **Input Validation**: All input is validated to avoid misuse or security vulnerabilities.
- **Authentication**: If running this on a public server, ensure proper authentication to prevent unauthorized access to cryptographic operations.
